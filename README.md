## Introduction

Artificial Intelligence (AI) has emerged as a transformative force reshaping industries and societies since its inception. From its early conceptualization as a pursuit of replicating human cognitive abilities to its modern-day application across diverse domains, the journey of AI reflects a relentless pursuit of innovation and advancement.  

Since its nascent stages in the mid-20th century, AI has undergone significant evolution, propelled by breakthroughs in computer science, mathematics, and cognitive psychology. The foundational work of pioneers such as Alan Turing, John McCarthy, and Marvin Minsky laid the groundwork for exploring the potential of algorithms to exhibit intelligent behavior.  

In our current project, we delve into the fundamental concepts of artificial intelligence (AI), including machine learning, data preprocessing, and descriptive data analysis.  

Moreover, our project entails practical hands-on experience with Python's powerful data manipulation library, pandas.

## 1. AI Watch


### Artificial Intelligence

AI is the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think and act like humans. Learning, reasoning, problem-solving, perception, and language comprehension are all examples of cognitive abilities.  

AI is a method of making a computer, a computer-controlled robot, or a software think intelligently like the human mind. AI is accomplished by studying the patterns of the human brain and by analyzing the cognitive process. The outcome of these studies develops intelligent software and systems.

### Machine Learning

Machine learning is a subfield of AI that uses algorithms trained on data sets to create models that enable machines to perform tasks that would otherwise only be possible for humans, such as categorizing images, analyzing data, or predicting price fluctuations.  

Today, machine learning is one of the most common forms of AI and often powers many of the digital goods and services we use every day.

### Data preprocessing

Data preprocessing transforms the data into a format that is more easily and effectively processed in data mining, machine learning and other data science tasks. The techniques are generally used at the earliest stages of the machine learning and AI development pipeline to ensure accurate results.  

There are several different tools and methods used for preprocessing data, including the following:  

- sampling, which selects a representative subset from a large population of data;  
- transformation, which manipulates raw data to produce a single input;  
- denoising, which removes noise from data;  
- imputation, which synthesizes statistically relevant data for missing values;  
- normalization, which organizes data for more efficient access;  
- feature extraction, which pulls out a relevant feature subset that is significant in a particular context.

### Descriptive Data Analysis

Data analytics can be broken into four key types:  

- *Descriptive*, which answers the question, “What happened?”  
- Diagnostic, which answers the question, “Why did this happen?”  
- Predictive, which answers the question, “What might happen in the future?”  
- Prescriptive, which answers the question, “What should we do next?”  

Descriptive analysis is an important phase in data exploration that involves summarizing and describing the primary properties of a dataset. It provides vital insights into the data’s frequency distribution, central tendency, dispersion, and identifying position.  

Descriptive analytics is especially useful for communicating change over time and uses trends as a springboard for further analysis to drive decision-making.

### Great blue whales

Largest Animals Ever: Blue whales hold the title of being the largest animals to have ever lived on Earth. These magnificent marine mammals can reach lengths of up to 100 feet and weigh upwards of 200 tons. To put that in perspective, their tongues alone can weigh as much as an elephant, and their hearts match the weight of an automobile12.

Krill Diet: Blue whales achieve their mind-boggling dimensions by feasting almost exclusively on tiny shrimp-like creatures called krill. During certain seasons, a single adult blue whale consumes about 4 tons of krill per day.

Baleen Whales: Blue whales belong to the group of baleen whales. They have fringed plates of fingernail-like material called baleen attached to their upper jaws. These giant animals feed by gulping an enormous mouthful of water, then using their massive tongue to force the water out through thin, overlapping baleen plates, leaving thousands of krill behind to be swallowed.

Coloring and Appearance: Underwater, blue whales appear true blue, but on the surface, their coloring is more mottled blue-gray. Their underbellies take on a yellowish hue due to the millions of microorganisms that reside in their skin.

Distinctive Features: Blue whales have a broad, flat head and a long, tapered body that ends in wide, triangular flukes. Their sheer size and unique appearance make them unmistakable.

Vocalization and Behavior: These graceful swimmers live in oceans worldwide (except the Arctic). They often spend summers feeding in polar waters and migrate toward the Equator as winter approaches. Blue whales are among the loudest animals on the planet, emitting a series of pulses, groans, and moans. In optimal conditions, they can hear each other up to 1,000 miles away. Scientists believe they use these vocalizations not only for communication but also for sonar navigation in the lightless ocean depths.

Calves: Blue whale calves are born already ranking among the planet’s largest creatures. After about a year inside their mother’s womb, a baby blue whale emerges, weighing up to 3 tons and stretching to 25 feet.

Mother-Calf Bond: The bond between a blue whale mother and calf is the strongest in the whale community. These nurturing giants ensure their offspring’s survival during the early stages of life.

Longevity: Blue whales can live up to 90 years in the wild, making their lifespan impressive given their immense size.

Conservation Status: Despite their grandeur, blue whales face threats such as ship strikes, entanglement in fishing gear, and habitat degradation. Conservation efforts are crucial to protect these gentle giants and ensure their continued existence.

In summary, blue whales are not only awe-inspiring in size but also vital indicators of our oceans’ health. Their survival depends on our collective commitment to conservation efforts134.

❤️ Diagnosis and Prediction

AI-based systems can assist in diagnosing diseases from medical images, genetic data, or other biometric inputs with accuracy sometimes surpassing that of humans. Examples include early detection of diseases such as cancer or cardiovascular conditions.

❤️ Treatment Personalization

AI enables a more personalized approach to medicine by tailoring treatments based on individual patient data. This can enhance treatment effectiveness and minimize side effects.

❤️ Hospital Resource Optimization

AI systems can predict high-demand periods for healthcare services, aid in managing medication stocks, and optimize staff schedules and equipment utilization.

❤️ Remote Continuous Monitoring

Thanks to AI, continuous remote health monitoring is possible. This allows for swift intervention in case of health deterioration, particularly beneficial for chronic or convalescent patients.

Conclusion

In summary, integrating artificial intelligence into healthcare has the potential not only to enhance the quality and accessibility of care but also to significantly reduce costs while providing more personalized and effective solutions for patients.
